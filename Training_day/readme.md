Training Day
===========

This is a custom campaign for *Warhammer Quest - Shadows over Hammeral*.

The campaign is built for 4 heroes, of which one must be a Cogsmith. The Gryph-Hound should not be included.
It assumes all heroes start at Level 1 (no achievements), but you can tweak it by forcing enemies to spawn with their special abilities (*Khorne Calls!* for Bloodreavers and Pink Horrors for Acolytes).

It's currently work-in-progress, have a look at the doc under `sources` for the overall gameplan.

Feedback is welcome; file an issue or mail me at g.lacava on gmail, or ping @toyg on twitter.

(Note that I tend to work in GIMP and export to Photoshop, so PSD files might be a bit rough.)
